# AI-Augmented Leadership

> How executive technology leaders orchestrate AI agents to scale impact, not replace humans.

This repository showcases my approach to AI-augmented leadership. It demonstrates how I leverage AI agents as executive productivity multipliers to drive business outcomes, enhance team performance, and maintain a strong governance posture.

## 🤖 My AI Philosophy: AI as a Co-pilot, Not an Autopilot

I believe that AI is a powerful tool for augmenting human intelligence, not replacing it. My approach is to use AI as a co-pilot to assist with tasks like code generation, data analysis, and research, while always keeping a human in the loop to review the output and make the final decision. This human-centric approach to AI ensures that we maintain control, accountability, and ethical standards in everything we do.
